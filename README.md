# Hangman-Game

The Hangman Game is a classic word-guessing game implemented in JavaScript. Players attempt to guess a hidden word by suggesting letters one at a time. Each incorrect guess results in a part of the hangman figure being drawn. The objective is to guess the word correctly before the hangman is fully drawn.

Features:

Random Word Selection: The game selects a random word for each session.
Letter Guessing: Players can input letters to guess the hidden word.
Limited Attempts: A maximum of 6 incorrect guesses are allowed before the game is lost.
Visual Representation: The hangman figure is drawn progressively with each incorrect guess.
Hints: Each word comes with a hint to assist the player.
How to Play:

The game randomly selects a hidden word and displays blank spaces representing each letter.
Players guess letters by clicking on the on-screen keyboard.
Correct guesses reveal the letter in the word; incorrect guesses add a part to the hangman figure.
The game continues until the player either guesses the word or exhausts all attempts.
